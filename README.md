# CIFAR-10: Object Recognition in Images Using Deep Convolutional Neural Network (DCNN)

In this project, we used deep convolutional neural network model trained on CIFAR-10 (Canadian Institute For Advanced Research) dataset to recognize multiple objects present in various images.

- Recognize 10 different objects which are airplanes, cars, birds, cats, deer, dogs, frogs, horses, ships and trucks.
- Trained the model on the CIFAR-10 (Canadian Institute For Advanced Research) dataset. There are 50000 training images and 10000 test
  images.
- Achieved an accuracy of 0.8005 after training for 100 epochs.
- Achieved a loss value of 0.5659 after training for 100 epochs.
- Achieved validation accuracy of 0.8147 after training for 100 epochs.
- Achieved a validation loss value of 0.5372 after training for 100 epochs.

# Dependencies
